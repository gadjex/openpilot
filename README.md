What is openpilot?
------

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of [supported car makes, models, and model years](docs/CARS.md). In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera-based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers. See more about [the vehicle integration](docs/INTEGRATION.md) and [limitations](docs/LIMITATIONS.md).

What is this fork for?
------

Ridgeline is my personal fork I am using for my 2022 Honda Ridgeline. It "should" work well on all 2021 - 2023 Honda Ridgelines and many of the features "should" work well on all offically supported vehicles especially Honda Nidec vehicles. Things are tuned to my taste and may not reflect yours. If you see a bug please let me know. I am open to suggested changes if they align with my tastes and abilities.

**USE THIS FORK AT YOUR OWN RISK. STAY ALERT AND ALWAYS BE READY TO TAKE OVER.**
